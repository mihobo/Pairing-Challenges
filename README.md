# Pairing-Challenges

Pairing Challenges

A series of challenges to complete in pairs. Try both Pairing Styles: Driver-Navigator and Ping-Pong.

All challenges are to transform data from one form to another in an elegant way. You can think of elegance as:

Working
Easy to read and understand
Fewest elements (functions, lines of code, iterators, and so on).
Challenge Set 1: Arrays

Transform the following first arrays into the second entities:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 3, 5, 4, 2] => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 3, 5, 4, 2] => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 15 (the sum)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 30 (twice the sum)
Challenge Set 2: Hashes

Transform the following first hashes into the second entities:

{ a: 1, b: 2 } => { a: 2, b: 3 }
{ a: 2, b: 5, c: 1 } => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 5 }
{ a: 2, b: 5, c: 1 } => [1, 2, 5]
{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 } => { "1"=>"a", "2"=>"b", "3"=>"c" }
